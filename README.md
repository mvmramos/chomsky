This repository containing the definitions and proof scripts related to the formalization of the Chomsky Normal Form for context-free grammars in Coq. The files in it contain the definitions, statements and proof scripts related to the correctness of:

- simplification of context-free grammars;
- Chomsky normalization of context-free grammars.

File list:

- allrules.v: generates all sentential forms over a given alphabet uo to a certain length;
- cfg.v: definitions and basic lemmas regarding context-free grammars and derivations;
- cfl.v: definitions and basic lemmas regarding context-free languages;
- chomsky.v: Chomsky grammar normalization;
- emptyrules.v: elimination of empty rules in a context-free grammar;
- inaccessible.v: elimination of inaccessible symbols in a context-free grammar;
- misc_arith.v: generic arithmetic related lemmas;
- misc_list.v: generic list lemmas;
- misc_logic: generic logic lemmas;
- simplification.v: unification of all previous results.
- unitrules.v: elimination of unit rules in a context-free grammar;
- useless.v: elimination of useless symbols in a context-free grammar;

To compile, download all files and:
- coq_makefile *.v -o _makefile
- make -f _makefile

The files have been created and compiled with the Coq Proof Assistant, version 8.9.0 (January 2019), under Ubuntu 17.04.

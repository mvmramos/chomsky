This repository containing the definitions and proof scripts related to the formalization of context-free language theory in Coq. The files in it contain the definitions, statements and proof scripts related to the correctness of:

- closure properties for context-free languages;
- simplification of context-free grammars;
- Chomsky normalization of context-free grammars and
- Pumping Lemma for context-free languages.

To compile, download all files and:
- coq_makefile *.v > _makefile
- make -f _makefile

The files have been created and compiled with the Coq Proof Assistant, version 8.4pl4 (June 2014).
